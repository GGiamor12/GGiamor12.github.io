Homework 2

- Please, complete our survey (or add new variables), so we have data

1.
Choose 3 variables from our surveys
- Qualitative
- Quantitative discrete
- Quantitative continuous

create the most efficient algorithms to compute the frequency (absolute/relative/percentage) distribution of:

- the 3 variables
- the joint distribution of 2 variables (use a general logic, where variables could be any number)


2.
For the following most important data structures (or others that you may want to suggest) find out how to:

-loop (break/continue)
-add/remove/get/check the existence of element

data structures:
array, list, dictionary, sorted list, HashSet, sorted set, queue, stack, linked list

Note in a very concise way your finding in your Js Cheatsheet, and, in case a corresponding Js object does not exists, create a simple equivalent class.

3.
Generate N uniform random variate [0,1) and determine the distribution into interval class [i/k, (i+1)/k), i = 0,..., k-1.
Play with N and k values and draw some conclusion on the shape
of the distribution.
