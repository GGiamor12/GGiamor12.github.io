#### **What's statistics?**
Statistics is a **branch of mathematics** and a field of study that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data.
Its primary purpose is to extract meaningful information and insights from data, which can be used for making informed decisions, drawing conclusions, and understanding patterns or trends in various phenomena.
The statistics contains:  
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data through surveys, experiments, observations, or other methods.  
2. **Data Analysis**: Examining and summarizing data using various statistical techniques, such as descriptive statistics 
(mean, median, mode, standard deviation), inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals), and data visualization (graphs, charts, histograms).  
3. **Data Interpretation**: Drawing conclusions and making inferences based on the analysis of data, including identifying patterns, correlations, and trends.  
4. **Probability**: Assessing the likelihood of events occurring and using probability theory to make predictions and decisions.  
5. **Sampling**: Selecting a subset of data (a sample) from a larger population to make inferences about the entire population.  
6. **Experimental Design**: Planning and conducting experiments to investigate relationships and causal effects between variables.  

Statistics plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, including science, business, social sciences, economics, medicine, engineering, and more. 
It helps researchers, analysts, and decision-makers make sense of data and make informed choices based on evidence rather than intuition or guesswork. 
Statistical methods are also used to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, and quantify uncertainty in various contexts.
